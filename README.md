# rbr-greek-codriver
Greek co-driver mod for Richard Burns Rally :car:

# Installation instructions
0. Backup the `Audio` and `Plugins` folders from the root directory of your RBR installation.
1. Download the latest version of the mod from [>here<](https://github.com/gstavrinos/rbr-greek-codriver/releases/latest)
2. Copy the files of this repository inside the root directory of your RBR installation.
3. Overwrite already existing files.
4. Select the `FRENCH` pacenotes in-game.
5. :greece: :car: :checkered_flag:

# Disclaimers
1. The mod has been tested only using the RSF RBR mod (aka Hungarian mod), but it should work with any installation of RBR that has the Pacenotes Plugin.
2. The mod overwrites only the necessary files from the game. Most of the files use their own namespace to avoid conflicts. In case you need to revert back to the default installation, you will need the original. (i.e. Look at the zero step of the installation instructions)
3. The mod was created in a weekend, thus it is most probably broken in multiple ways. (Please report any issue.)
